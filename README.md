#Micromanager

##Purpose
A simple interface for sending timed e-mails to individuals and groups.

##Functionality
The main functions of our project are the following.

1. Send an email at a prescribed time rather than immediately, acting as a automatic reminder
2. Form groups of individuals that are visible to everyone
3. Send timed emails within those groups

We used a combination of the `rufus-scheduler` gem and the `http-party` gem to run the timed email functionality.

##Design Philosophy

The goal of the app is to make life more simple. As a result, all the groups are displayed on a single page, and from a group page, the user can customize all parameters from a single location.


##Social Integration

Users can create groups of friends based on common interests, whether they live in the same apartment or work in the same cubicle. All members of the group will be visible to improve communication, and users can specify whether timed texts appear only to a single member or all the members of the group.
