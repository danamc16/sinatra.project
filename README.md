##Purpose
A simple interface for sending timed text messages to individuals and groups.

##Functionality
The main functions of our project are the following.

1. Send a text message at a prescribed time rather than immediately, acting as a automatic reminder
2. Form playlists of individuals that can view and connect with each other
3. Send timed text messages within those groups

##Design Philosophy

##Social Integration

Users can create "playlists" of friends based on common interests, whether they live in the same apartment or work in the same cubicle. All members of the group will be visible to improve communication, and users can specify whether timed texts appear only to a single member or all the members of the group.
